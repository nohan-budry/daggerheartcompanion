        <h1>Welcome to Daggerheart Companion</h1>

        <p>This web app is a personal project I created while learning and preparing to play Daggerheart with friends.
            It includes content from the Daggerheart SRD 1.0.</p>

        <p>You'll find all the essential information for Game Masters and Players with a focus on game content for now.
            Additional information about game mechanics and rules will be added over time.</p>

        <p>This is a non-commercial fan project. It only includes material available in the SRD, and is meant to make
            that information easier to access and use.</p>

        <p>Feel free to use and share this companion to support your games and find information quickly with the search
            feature (ctrl+k or cmd+k)!</p>

        <p>There are still a lot of content and features to add. So keep visiting regularly to check out what's new.</p>
