# Game Master (GM)

The GM is responsible for guiding the narrative and
roleplaying the world the PCs inhabit. This section provides
you with advice for running Daggerheart: using the core
mechanics; creating memorable encounters; planning exciting
sessions; selecting, creating, and using GM moves; crafting a
full campaign; running dynamic NPCs; and more.

# GM Guidance

These three sections provide a foundation to help you get the
most out of this game. The “GM Principles” are your guiding
star—when in doubt, return to these principles.

## GM Principles

### Begin and End With the Fiction

Use the fiction to drive mechanics, then connect the mechanics
back to the fiction.

### Collaborate at All Times, Especially During Conflict

The PCs are the protagonists of the campaign; antagonism
between player and GM should exist only in the fiction.

### Fill the World With Life, Wonder, and Danger

Showcase rich cultures, take the PCs to wondrous places, and
introduce them to dangerous creatures.

### Ask Questions and Incorporate the Answers

Ensuring that the players’ ideas are included results in a
narrative that supports the whole group’s creativity.

### Give Every Roll Impact

Only ask the players to roll during meaningful moments.

### Play to Find Out What Happens

Be surprised by what the characters do, the choices they make,
and the people they become.

### Hold on Gently

Don’t worry if you need to abandon or alter something that
came before.

## GM Practices

### Cultivate a Curious Table

Follow what catches the players’ interest to foster an
environment of creative inquiry.

### Gain Your Players' Trust

Act in good faith, follow through on your promises, admit your
mistakes.

### Keep The Story Moving Forward

Advance the story through escalating action, new information,
or changing circumstances after every action roll, whether it
succeeds or fails.

### Cut To The Action
Skip past the boring bits. When a scene drags on, end it.

### Help The Players Use The Game
Players have more fun when you help them understand the
system.

### Create A Meta Conversation

Empower players to speak out of character, use safety tools, and
ask for clarification.

### Tell Them What They Would know

Don’t hide obvious details or important information from the
players.

### Ground The World In Motive

An NPC’s actions flow from their goals and desires.

### Bring The Game's Mechanics To Life

Set a good example of how fiction and mechanics work together
to enhance the game experience.

### Reframe Rather Than Reject

If a player’s contribution conflicts with the fiction, work with
them to reshape it.

### Work In Moments And Moontages

When framing a scene, decide which beats should be savored
and which shouldn’t linger.

## Pitfalls To Avoid

### Undermining The Heroes

If a roll doesn’t go well, show how it was impacted by an
adversary’s prowess, environmental factors, or unexpected
surprises, rather than the PC’s incompetence.

### Always Telling The Players What To Roll

Let the players decide how to handle a challenge.

### Letting Scenes DRAG

Shake it up or cut away when a scene has concluded, the
table’s energy is flagging, or people are talking in circles.

### Singular Solutions

Don’t get hung up on one right answer to a problem. If the
players have a clever idea, make it work.

### Overplanning

Spend your prep time inventing situations instead of scripting
scenes. If the players surprise you, take a break to think
through your options.

### Hoarding Fear
Spend Fear when you have the opportunity. The players will
always generate more.

# Core GM Mechanics

## Rolling Dice

The GM has no Duality Dice; instead, they roll a single d20
called the GM’s Die.

## Adversary Attack Rolls

When an adversary attacks a PC, roll your d20 and add the
adversary’s attack bonus to the result. If the total meets or
beats the target’s Evasion, the attack succeeds; otherwise, the
attack fails. On a successful attack, roll the attack’s damage
dice to determine how much it deals.

If you roll a natural 20 on an attack, your roll automatically
succeeds and you deal extra damage. Roll damage normally,
then add the highest number on the damage dice to the total.
For example, an attack that deals 3d6+2 deals 18+3d6+2 on
a critical success; the critical success does not affect the flat
damage modifier.

> Note: a critical success on an adversary’s reaction roll
automatically succeeds, but confers no additional benefit.

### Guidance On Action Rolls

After a player describes a move they want to make during
the game, you might decide an action roll is necessary to
determine how the scene progresses. Use this guide to
determine what to present the player, choosing whichever
option best fits the situation:

- Determine whether the roll is necessary, considering the
PC’s Experiences or backstory, the pressure they’re acting
under, and the possible outcomes.
- Establish the stakes of an action roll before the player
makes it.
- Communicate any unavoidable consequences.
- If desired, you can offer the player the opportunity to forgo
an action roll in exchange for agreeing to an interesting
outcome, cost, or complication.

## Making Moves

As the GM, you have GM moves that change the story in
response to the players’ actions. GM moves aren’t bound by
specific spells or effects—when you make a GM move, you
can describe the action in whatever way the fiction demands.
GM moves happen during GM turns. A GM turn begins when
the spotlight passes to them and ends when the spotlight
passes back to the players.

### When To Make A Move

The GM can make a GM move whenever you want, but the
frequency and severity depends on the type of story you’re
telling, the actions your players take, and the tone of the
session you’re running.

Make a GM move when the players:

- Roll with Fear
- Fail an action roll
- Do something that has unavoidable consequences
- Give you a “golden opportunity” (an opening that demands
an immediate response)
- Look to you for what happens next

### Choosing GM Moves

The result of a player’s action roll determines your response:

On a **Critical Success**, you let the player describe their
success, then give them an additional opportunity or
advantage.

On a **Success with Hope**, you let the player describe their
success, then you show how the world reacts to it.

On a **Success with Fear**, you work with the player to
describe their success, then take a Fear and make a GM
move to introduce a minor consequence, complication, or
cost:

- An adversary attacks
- The PC marks a Stress
- You introduce a new threat
- You raise the stakes of the conflict

On a **Failure with Hope**, you describe how the PC fails to
get what they want, then make a GM move to introduce a
minor consequence, complication, or cost:

- An adversary attacks
- The PC marks a Stress
- You introduce a new threat
- You raise the stakes of the conflict
- 
On a **Failure with Fear**, you describe how things go wrong,
then make a GM move to introduce a major consequence,
complication, or cost:

- You put them in immediate danger
- They become the focus of multiple adversaries
- They are separated from their party
- They lose an important opportunity for good.

### Quick Reference: Resolving Actions Rolls

If you’re unsure how to resolve a roll, think about these quick
phrases:

**Success with Hope:** Yes, and… (You get what you want and
gain a Hope.)

**Success with Fear:** Yes, but… (You get what you want, but
there’s a consequence, and the GM gains a Fear.)

**Failure with Hope:** No, but… (Things don’t go as planned,
but you gain a Hope.)

**Failure with Fear:** No, and… (Things don’t go as planned
and it gets worse. The GM gains a Fear.)

If the move you should make is not obvious from the fiction,
draw inspiration from the “Example GM Moves” list:

- Introduce a new obstacle or enemy
- Ask the player what happens
- Have the PC mark a Stress
- Tell the players “everything is fine… for now.”

### Soft And Hard Moves

Soft moves go easier on the players—they give the party new
information about the scene and offer them an opportunity to
react to it. Hard moves are harsher, more impactful, or more
direct—the PCs don’t get an opening to interrupt, alter, or
anticipate the outcome.

Use softer moves on rolls with Hope and harder moves on
rolls with Fear.

## Example GM Moves
- Show how the world reacts
- Ask a question and build on the answer
- Make an NPC act in accordance with their motive
- Drive a PC to take action by dangling their goals in
front of them
- Signal an imminent off-screen threat
- Reveal an unwelcome truth or unexpected danger
- Force the group to split up
- Make a PC mark Stress
- Make a move the characters don’t see
- Show the collateral damage
- Clear an adversary’s condition
- Shift the environment
- Spotlight an adversary
- Capture someone or something important
- Use a PC’s backstory against them
- Take away an opportunity permanently

## Using Fear

You start a campaign with 1 Fear per PC in the party.

You gain Fear whenever a PC rolls with Fear, the PCs take a
rest (see: Downtime), or when an ability or effect tells you to.

You can never have more than 12 Fear at one time.

Fear carries over between sessions.

Spend a Fear to:

- Interrupt the players to steal the spotlight and make a
move
- Make an additional GM move
- Use an adversary’s Fear Feature
- Use an environment’s Fear Feature
- Add an adversary’s Experience to a roll
- 

The dramatic tension of a scene correlates with the amount of
Fear you spend during it. For guidance on how much Fear you
should spend in a scene, consult the following table:

### How Much Fear To Spend In A Scene
**Incidental (0-1 Fear):** A catch-up between PCs
after an emotionally charged
scene; gathering information;
resupplying at a local market;
resting during downtime.

**Minor (1-3 Fear):** A travel sequence; a minor
skirmish that introduces new
foes or signals future trouble.

**Standard (2-4 Fear):** A substantial battle with a
notable objective; perilous
travel that tests might and
wit; a tense social encounter
seeking crucial information
or aid.

**Major (4-8 Fear):** A large battle with a Solo
or Leader adversary; a
character-defining scene
with a significant change to
a character’s personal story
(such as revelation, growth,
and betrayal).

**Climactic (6-12 Fear)** A major confrontation with
the villain of a story arc;
an epic set piece battle; a
judicial duel to determine an
important NPC’s fate.

If you find yourself with a large amount of Fear, consider:

- **Spending Fast**: Spend Fear before the players have a
chance to react
- **Spending Often**: Spend Fear every time the spotlight
swings to you
- **Spending Big**: Spend Fear to make multiple moves in a row
- 
Spending Fear to make a move communicates the increased
impact of your action. Fear moves often include one or more
of these elements:

- Introducing new adversaries to a scene when their
appearance hasn’t been foreshadowed or lacks context.
- An adversary activating a powerful spell or transformation
to deal massive damage or boost their capabilities.
- An environment exerting a strong negative effect on the
party.
