# Flow of the Game

Daggerheart is a conversation. The GM describes fictional
scenarios involving the PCs, and the players take turns
describing how their characters react. The goal of every
person at the table is to build upon everyone else’s ideas and
collaboratively tell a satisfying story. The system facilitates
this collaborative process by providing structure to the
conversation and mechanics for resolving moments of tension
where fate or fortune determine the outcome of events.

## Player Principles and Best Practices

To get the most out of Daggerheart, we recommend players
keep the following principles and practices in mind throughout
each session:

### Principles

- Be a fan of your character and their journey.
- Spotlight your friends.
- Address the characters and address the players.
- Build the world together.
- Play to find out what happens.
- Hold on gently.

### Best Practices

- Embrace danger.
- Use your resources.
- Tell the story.
- Discover your character.

> For more information, see the Daggerheart Core Rulebook, pages 9 and 108.

# Core Gameplay Loop

The core gameplay loop is the procedure that drives every
scene, both in and out of combat:

## Step 1: Set the Scene

The GM describes a scenario, establishing the PCs’
surroundings and any dangers, NPCs, or other important
details the characters would notice.

## Step 2: Ask and Answer Questions

The players ask clarifying questions to explore the scene
more deeply and gather information that could inform their
characters’ actions. The GM responds to these questions by
giving the players information their characters could easily
obtain, or by asking questions of their own to the players. The
players also respond to any questions the GM poses to them.
In this way, the table builds out the fiction collaboratively.

## Step 3: Build on the Fiction

As the scene develops, the players find opportunities to take
action—problems to solve, obstacles to overcome, mysteries
to investigate, and so on. The players describe how their
characters proceed; if their proposed actions carry no chance
of failure (or if failure would be boring), they automatically
succeed. But if the outcome of their action is unknown,
the GM calls for an action roll. Either way, the table works
the outcome into the story and moves the fiction forward,
narrating how the PC’s actions have changed things.

# Step 4: Go Back T Step 1

The process repeats from the beginning, with the GM relaying
any updated details or material changes to the players. This
process continues until the end of the scene is triggered by a
mechanic or arrives organically.

# The Spotlight

The **spotlight** is a symbol that represents the table’s
attention—and therefore the immediate focus of both the
narrative and the game mechanics. Any time a character
or player becomes the focus of a scene, they “are in the
spotlight” or “have the spotlight.”
The spotlight moves around the table organically as scenes
unfold unless a mechanical trigger determines where the
spotlight goes next. For example, when a player fails an action
roll, the mechanics prompt the GM to seize the spotlight and
make a GM move.

# Turn Order and Action Economy

Daggerheart’s turns don’t follow a traditional, rigid format:
there is no explicit initiative mechanic and characters don’t
have a set number of actions they can take or things they can
do before the spotlight passes to someone else. A player with
the spotlight describes what their character does and the
spotlight simply swings to whoever:

- the fiction would naturally turn it toward
- hasn’t had the focus in a while, or
- a triggered mechanic puts it on

## Optional: Spotlight Tracker Tool

If your group prefers a more traditional action economy,
you can use tokens to track how many times a player has
had the spotlight: At the start of a session or scene, each
player adds a certain number of tokens (we recommend 3)
to their character sheet and removes a token each
time they take an action. If the spotlight would swing to
someone without any tokens, it swings to someone else
instead. Once every player has used all their available
tokens, players refill their character sheet with the same
number of tokens as before, then continue playing.

# Making Moves and Taking Action

Any time a character does something to advance the story,
such as speaking with another character, interacting with the
environment, making an attack, casting a spell, or using a
class feature, they are making a move.

## Action Rolls

Any move where success would be trivial or failure would be
boring automatically succeeds, but any move that’s difficult to
accomplish or risky to attempt triggers an action roll.

## Overview

All action rolls require a pair of d12s called Duality Dice.
These are two visually distinct twelve-sided dice, with one die
representing Hope and the other representing Fear.
To make an action roll, you roll the Duality Dice, sum the
results, apply any relevant modifiers, and compare the total to
a Difficulty number to determine the outcome:

- **Success with Hope:** If your total meets or beats the
Difficulty AND your Hope Die shows a higher result than
your Fear Die, you rolled a “Success with Hope.” You
succeed and gain a Hope.
- **Success with Fear:** If your total meets or beats the
Difficulty AND your Fear Die shows a higher result than
your Hope Die, you rolled a “Success with Fear.” You
succeed with a cost or complication, but the GM gains a
Fear.
- **Failure with Hope:** If your total is less than the Difficulty
AND your Hope Die shows a higher result than your Fear
Die, you rolled a “Failure with Hope.” You fail with a minor
consequence and gain a Hope, then the spotlight swings
to the GM.
- **Failure with Fear:** If your total is less than the Difficulty
AND your Fear Die shows a higher result than your Hope
Die, you rolled a “Failure with Fear.” You fail with a major
consequence and the GM gains a Fear, then the spotlight
swings to the GM.
- **Critical Success**: If the Duality Dice show matching
results, you rolled a “Critical Success” (“Crit”). You
automatically succeed with a bonus, gain a Hope, and
clear a Stress. If this was an attack roll, you deal critical
damage.

> Note: A Critical Success counts as a roll “with Hope.”
After resolving the action roll, the table works together to
weave the outcome into the narrative and play continues.

### Failing Forward

In Daggerheart, every time you roll the dice, the scene
changes in some way. There is no such thing as a roll where
“nothing happens,” because the fiction constantly evolves
based on the successes and failures of the characters.

## Procedure

The following steps describe in more detail the procedure that
all action rolls utilize:

### Step 1: Pick an Appropriate Trait

Some actions and effects specify in their description which
trait applies to the roll; otherwise, the GM tells the acting
player which character trait best applies to the action being
attempted. If more than one trait could apply to the roll, the
GM chooses or lets the acting player decide.

### Step 2: Determine The Difficulty

Some actions and features say in their description what the
Difficulty is. Otherwise, the GM determines the Difficulty
based on the scenario. The GM can choose whether to share
the Difficulty with the table. In either case, the GM should
communicate the potential consequences of failure to the
acting player.

### Step 3: Apply Extra Dice and Modifiers

The acting player decides whether to Utilize an Experience or
activate other effects, then, if applicable, adds the appropriate
tokens and dice (such as advantage or Rally dice) to their dice
pool.

> Note: Unless an action, ability, or feature specifically allows
for it, a player must declare the use of any Experiences, extra
dice, or other modifiers before they roll.

### Step 4: Roll The Dice

The acting player rolls their entire dice pool and announces
the results in the format of “\[total result] with \[Hope/Fear]”—
or “Critical Success!” in the case of matching Duality Dice.
> Example: A player is making an action roll with a +1 in the
relevant trait and no other modifiers; they roll the Duality
Dice and get a result of 5 on their Hope Die and 7 on their
Fear Die, then announce “I rolled a 13 with Fear!”

### Step 5: Resolve the Outcome

The active player and the GM work together, along with the
suggestions and support of the rest of the table, to resolve the
outcome of the action.

## GM Moves

GMs also make moves. They should consider making a move
when a player does one of the following things:

- Rolls with Fear on an action roll.
- Fails an action roll.
- Does something that would have consequences.
- Gives them a golden opportunity.
- Looks to them for what happens next.

After the GM turn is done, the spotlight goes back to the PCs.
Many adversaries and environments have Fear Features,
especially powerful or consequential moves that the GM must
spend Fear to activate.

> Note: This Fear is in addition to any Fear the GM has
previously spent to seize the spotlight or activate another
action or ability.

## Adversary Actions

When play passes to the GM, the GM can make a GM move to
spotlight an adversary. A spotlighted adversary can:

- Move within Close range and make a standard attack
- Move within Close range and use an adversary action
- Clear a condition
- Sprint within Far or Very Far range on the battlefield
- Do anything else the fiction demands or the GM deems
appropriate

The GM can spend additional Fear to spotlight additional
adversaries. Once the GM has finished, the spotlight swings
back to the PCs.

## Special Rolls

Some rolls have unique specifications or otherwise modify
the action roll procedure: trait rolls, Spellcast Rolls, attack
rolls, and damage rolls. Unless otherwise noted, you can apply
any bonus, modifier, or effect to a special roll as if it were a
standard action roll.

### Trait Rolls

An action roll that specifies which character trait applies to it
is called a trait roll. In the text of a feature or effect, a trait roll
is referenced with the format “[Trait] Roll (Difficulty)” (e.g.,
“Agility Roll (12)”). If the text of an effect doesn’t specify a
trait roll’s Difficulty, the GM sets the Difficulty based on the
circumstances.

Features and effects that affect a trait roll also affect any
action roll that uses the same trait, including attack rolls,
Spellcast rolls, and standard action rolls.

> Example: The katari’s ancestry feature “Feline Instincts,”
which allows the katari to reroll an Agility Roll, can also
be used on a standard action roll using Agility to traverse
dangerous terrain or on an attack roll made with a
weapon that uses Agility.

### Spellcast Rolls

Spellcast Rolls are trait rolls that require you to use your
Spellcast trait. Your Spellcast trait, if you have one, is
determined by your subclass.

Spellcast Rolls are only made when a character uses a feature
that requires one. A successful Spellcast Roll activates the
effect as described by the feature.

> Notes: A Spellcast Roll that can damage a target is also considered
an attack roll.
>
> When you cast a spell, the text tells you when the effect ends.
The GM can spend a Fear to end a temporary effect. If your
spell doesn’t specify when it ends, it ends when you choose or
at a natural moment of the story. You can choose to end your
spell early.
> 
> You can cast and maintain the effects of more than one spell
at the same time.

### Reaction Rolls

A reaction roll is made in response to an attack or a hazard,
representing a character’s attempt to avoid or withstand an
imminent effect.

Reaction rolls work like action rolls, except they don’t generate
Hope or Fear, don’t trigger additional GM moves, and other
characters can’t aid you with Help an Ally.

If you critically succeed on a reaction roll, you don’t clear
a Stress or gain a Hope, but you do ignore any effects that
would have impacted you on a success, such as taking
damage or marking Stress.

### Grouyp Action Rolls

When multiple PCs take action together, the party chooses
one PC to lead the action. Each other player then describes
how their character collaborates on the task. The leader
makes an action roll as usual, while the other players make
reaction rolls using whichever traits they and the GM decide
fit best.

The lead character gains a +1 bonus to their lead action roll for
each of these reaction rolls that succeeded and a −1 penalty
for each these reaction rolls that failed.

### Tag Team Rolls

Each player can, once per session, initiate a Tag Team Roll
between their character and another PC by spending 3 Hope.
The players work with one another to describe how they
combine their actions in a unique and exciting way. Both
players make separate action rolls; before resolving the roll’s
outcome, choose one of the rolls to apply to both actions. On
a roll with Hope, all PCs involved gain a Hope. On a roll with
Fear, the GM gains a Fear token for each PC involved.
On a successful Tag Team attack roll, both players roll damage
and add the totals together to determine the damage dealt,
which is then treated as if it came from a single source. If the
attacks deal different types of damage, the players choose
which type to deal.

> Notes: A Tag Team Roll counts as a single action roll for the
purposes of any countdowns or features that track action
rolls.
>
> Though each player may only initiate one Tag Team Roll per
session, one PC can be involved in multiple Tag Team Rolls.

# Advantage and Disadvantage

Some features and effects let you roll with advantage or
disadvantage on an action or reaction roll:

- Advantage represents an opportunity that you seize to
increase your chances of success. When you roll with
advantage, you roll a d6 advantage die with your dice pool
and add its result to your total.
- Disadvantage represents an additional difficulty, hardship,
or challenge you face when attempting an action. When
you roll with disadvantage, you roll a d6 disadvantage die
with your dice pool and subtract its result from your total.
Advantage or disadvantage can be granted or imposed by
mechanical triggers or at the GM’s discretion. When a PC aids
you with Help an Ally, they roll their own advantage die and
you add it to your total.

Advantage and disadvantage dice cancel each out, one-for-one, when they would be added to the same dice pool, so
you’ll never roll both at the same time. If you have advantage
or disadvantage from other sources that don’t affect your own
dice pool, such as another player’s Help an Ally move, their
effects stack with your rolled results.

# Hope and Fear

Hope and Fear are metacurrencies representing the cosmic
forces that shape the events of your table’s story. Hope
powers PC abilities and features, while Fear powers the
abilities of the GM and the adversaries and environments they
control.

### Hope

Every PC starts with 2 Hope at character creation and gains
more throughout play. A PC can have a maximum of 6 Hope at
one time, and Hope carries over between sessions.
Players can spend Hope to:

- Help an Ally
When you Help an Ally who is making an action roll,
describe how you do so and roll an advantage die. Multiple
players can spend Hope to help the same acting player,
but that player only adds the highest result to their final
total.
- Utilize an Experience
When you Utilize an Experience on a relevant roll, add its
modifier to the result. You can spend multiple Hope to
utilize multiple Experiences.
- Initiate a Tag Team Roll
Spend 3 Hope to initiate a Tag Team roll, combining the
actions of two PCs into one impressive act of synergy.
When you make a Tag Team roll, both players roll their
action rolls and then choose which set of results to apply
to the outcome.
- Activate a Hope Feature
A Hope Feature is any effect that allows (or requires) you
to spend a specified amount of Hope to activate it. Class
Hope features are class-specific features, detailed on your
character sheet, that cost 3 Hope to activate.

> Note: When using a Hope Feature, if you rolled with Hope
for that action, the Hope you gain from that roll can be spent
on that feature (or toward it, if it requires spending multiple
Hope).

### Fear

The GM gains Fear whenever a player rolls with Fear and can
spend Fear at any time to make or enhance a GM move or to
use a Fear Feature. The GM can have up to 12 Fear at one
time. Fear carries over between sessions.

# Combat

Though Daggerheart relies on the same flow of collaborative
storytelling in and out of combat, physical conflicts rely
more heavily on several key mechanics related to attacking,
maneuvering, and taking damage.

## Evasion

Evasion represents a character’s ability to avoid attacks and
other unwanted effects. Any roll made against a PC has a
Difficulty equal to the target’s Evasion. A PC’s base Evasion
is determined by their class, but can be modified by domain
cards, equipment, conditions, and other effects.

> Note: attacks rolled against adversaries use the target’s
Difficulty instead of Evasion.

## Hit Points and Damage Thresholds

Hit Points (HP) represent a character’s ability to withstand
physical injury. When a character takes damage, they mark 1
to 3 HP, based on their damage thresholds:

- If the final damage is at or above the character’s Severe
damage threshold, they mark 3 HP.
- If the final damage is at or above the character’s Major
damage threshold but below their Severe damage
threshold, they mark 2 HP.
- If the final damage is below the character’s Major damage
threshold, they mark 1 HP.
- If incoming damage is ever reduced to 0 or less, no HP is
marked.

A PC’s damage thresholds are calculated by adding their level
to the listed damage thresholds of their equipped armor. A
PC’s starting HP is based on their class, but they can gain
additional Hit Points through advancements, features, and
other effects.

An adversary’s Damage Thresholds and HP are listed in their
stat blocks.

When a character marks their last Hit Point, they fall. If a PC
falls, they make a death move.

Characters can clear Hit Points by taking downtime moves
(see: Downtime) or by activating relevant special abilities or
effects.

### Optional Rule: Massive Damage

If a character ever takes damage equal to twice their
Severe threshold, they mark 4 HP instead of 3.

## Stress

Stress represents how much mental, physical, and emotional
strain a character can endure. Some special abilities or effects
require the character activating them to mark Stress, and
the GM can require a PC to mark Stress as a GM move or to
represent the cost, complication, or consequence of an action
roll.

When a character marks their last Stress, they become
Vulnerable (see: Conditions) until they clear at least 1 Stress.
When a character must mark 1 or more Stress but can’t, they
mark 1 HP instead. A character can’t use a move that requires
them to mark Stress if all of their Stress is marked.
PCs can clear Stress by making downtime moves (see:
Downtime). A PC’s maximum Stress is determined by their
class, but they can increase it through advancements, abilities,
and other effects.

## Attacking

### Attack Rolls

An attack roll is an action roll intended to inflict harm. The
trait that applies to an attack roll is specified by the weapon
or spell being used. Unarmed attack rolls use either Strength
or Finesse (GM’s choice). An attack roll’s Difficulty, unless
otherwise noted, is equal to the Difficulty score of its target.

### Damage Rolls

On a successful attack, roll damage. Damage is calculated
from the damage roll listed in the attack’s description with the
format “xdy+[modifier]” (e.g., for a spell that inflicts “1d8+2”
damage, you roll an eight-sided and add 2 to the result; the
damage dealt is equal to the total).

Any time an effect says to deal damage using your Spellcast
trait, you roll a number of dice equal to your Spellcast trait.

> Note: If your Spellcast trait is +0 or lower, you don’t roll
anything.

For weapons, the number of damage dice you roll is equal
to your Proficiency. Note that your Proficiency multiplies the
number of dice you roll, but doesn’t affect the modifier. For
example, a PC with Proficiency 2 and wielding a weapon with a
damage rating of “d8+2” deals damage equal to “2d8+2” on a
successful attack.

Successful unarmed attacks inflict [Proficiency]d4 damage.

### Critical Damage

When you get a critical success (i.e., you roll matching values
on your Duality Dice) on an attack roll, you deal extra damage.
Make the damage roll as usual, but add the maximum possible
result of the damage dice to the final total. For instance, if an
attack would normally deal 2d8+1 damage, a critical success
would deal 2d8+1+16.

### Damage Types

There are two damage types: physical damage (phy) and
magic damage (mag). Unless stated otherwise, mundane
weapons and unarmed attacks deal physical damage, and
spells deal magic damage.

### Resistance, Immunity, and Direct Damage

If a target has resistance to a damage type, then they reduce
incoming damage of that type by half before comparing it to
their Hit Point Thresholds. If the target has additional ways
of reducing incoming damage, such as marking Armor Slots,
they apply the resistance effect first. The effects of multiple
resistances to the same damage type do not stack.
If a target has immunity to a damage type, they ignore
incoming damage of that type.

If an attack deals both physical and magic damage, a
character can only benefit from resistance or immunity if they
are resistant or immune to both damage types.

Direct damage is damage that can’t be reduced by marking
Armor Slots.

### Multi-Target Attack Rolls

If a spell or ability allows you to target multiple adversaries,
make one attack roll and one damage roll, then apply the
results to each target individually.

### Multiple Damage Sources

Damage dealt simultaneously from multiple sources is always
totaled before it’s compared to its target’s damage thresholds.

> For example, if a PC with orc ancestry makes a successful
attack against a target in Melee range and decides to
spend a Hope to use their “Tusks” feature (which gives
them an extra 1d6 damage on a damage roll), they would
roll their normal weapon damage and add a d6 to the
result, then deal that total damage to the adversary.

# Maps, Range, and Movement

You can play Daggerheart using “theater of the mind” or maps
and miniatures. The conversions below from abstract ranges
to physical measurements assume 1 inch of map represents
about 5 feet of fictional space.
Daggerheart uses the following ranges to translate fictional
positioning into relative distance for the purposes of targeting,
movement, and other game mechanics:

- **Melee:** Close enough to touch, up to a few feet away.
- **Very Close:** Close enough to see fine details, about 5–10
feet away. While in danger, a character can move, as part
of their action, from Very Close range into Melee range. On
a map: anything within the shortest length of a game card
(2-3 inches).
- **Close:** Close enough to see prominent details, about
10–30 feet away. While in danger, a character can move,
as part of their action, from Close range into Melee range.
On a map: anything within the length of a pencil (5-6 inches).
- **Far:** Close enough to see very little detail, about 30–100
feet away. While in danger, a character must make an 
Agility Roll to safely move from Far range into Melee range.
On a map: anything within the length of the long edge of a
piece of copy paper (11–12 inches).
- **Very Far:** Too far to make out any details, about 100–300
feet away. While in danger, a character must make an
Agility Roll to safely move from Very Far range into Melee
range. On a map: anything beyond Far range, but still within
the bounds of the conflict or scene.
- **Out of Range:** Anything beyond a character’s Very Far
range is Out of Range and usually can’t be targeted.

Range is measured from the source of an effect, such as the
attacker or spellcaster, to the target or object of an effect.
A weapon, spell, ability, item, or other effect’s stated range is
a maximum range; unless otherwise noted, it can be used at
closer distances.

### Optional Rule: Defined Ranges

If your table would rather operate with more precise range
rules, you can use a 1-inch grid battle map during combat.
If you do, use the following guidelines for play:
- Melee: 1 square
- Very Close: 3 squares
- Close: 6 squares
- Far: 12 squares
- Very Far: 13+ squares
- Out of Range: Off the battlemap

### Movement Under Pressure

When you’re under pressure or in danger and make an action
roll, you can move to a location within Close range as part of
that action. If you’re not already making an action roll, or if
you want to move farther than your Close range, you need to
succeed on an Agility Roll to safely reposition yourself.
An adversary can move within Close range for free as part of
an action, or within Very Far range as a separate action.

### Area of Effect

Unless stated otherwise, all the targets of a group effect must
be within Very Close range of a single origin point within your
effect’s range.

### Line of sight and Cover
Unless stated otherwise, a ranged attacker must have line
of sight to their intended target to make an attack roll. If a
partial obstruction lies between the attacker and target, the
target has cover. Attacks made through cover are rolled with
disadvantage. If the obstruction is total, there is no line of
sight.

# Conditions

Conditions are effects that grant specific benefits or
drawbacks to the target they are attached to.

## Standard Conditions

Daggerheart has three standard conditions:

### Hidden

While you’re out of sight from all enemies and they
don’t otherwise know your location, you gain the Hidden
condition. Any rolls against a Hidden creature have
disadvantage. After an adversary moves to where they
would see you, you move into their line of sight, or you
make an attack, you are no longer Hidden.

### Restrained

Restrained characters can’t move, but you can still take
actions from their current position.

### Vunerable

When a creature is Vulnerable, all rolls targeting them have
advantage.

Some features can apply special or unique conditions, which
work as described in the feature text.

Unless otherwise noted, the same condition can’t be applied
more than once to the same target.

## Temporary Tags and Special Conditions

The **temporary** tag denotes a condition or effect that the
affected creature can clear by making a move against it. When
an affected PC makes a move to clear a temporary condition
or effect, it normally requires a successful action roll using
an appropriate trait. When an affected adversary makes a
move to clear a temporary condition or effect, the GM puts
the spotlight on the adversary and describes how they do it;
this doesn’t require a roll but it does use up that adversary’s
spotlight.

**Special conditions** are only cleared when specific requirements
are met, such as completing a certain action or using a
particular item. The requirements for clearing these conditions
are stated in the text of the effect that applies the condition.

# Downtime

Between conflicts, the party can take a rest to recover
expended resources and deepen their bonds. During a rest,
each PC can make up to two downtime moves.
When the party rests, they must choose between a short rest
and a long rest. If a party takes three short rests in a row, their
next rest must be a long rest.

## Short Rests

If a short rest is interrupted, such as by an adversary's
attack, the characters don’t gain its benefits. If a long rest is
interrupted, the characters only gain the benefits of a short
rest.

A short rest lasts enough time for the party to catch its
breath, about an hour in-world. Each player can move domain
cards between their loadout and vault for free, then choose
twice from the following list of downtime moves (players can
choose the same move twice):

- **Tend to Wounds:** Clear 1d4+Tier Hit Points for yourself or
an ally.
- **Clear Stress:** Clear 1d4+Tier Stress.
- **Repair Armor:** Clear 1d4+Tier Armor Slots from your or an
ally’s armor.
- **Prepare:** Describe how you prepare yourself for the path
ahead, then gain a Hope. If you choose to Prepare with one
or more members of your party, you each gain 2 Hope.

**At the end of a short rest**, any features or effects with a
limited number of uses per rest refresh and any features or
effects that last until your next rest expire.

## Long Rests

A long rest is when the characters make camp and relax or
sleep for several in-game hours. Each player can move domain
cards between their loadout and vault for free, then choose
twice from the following list of downtime moves (players can
choose the same move twice):

- **Tend to All Wounds:** Clear all Hit Points for yourself or an
ally.
- **Clear All Stress:** Clear all Stress.
- **Repair All Armor:** Clear all Armor Slots from your or an
ally’s armor
- **Prepare:** Describe how you prepare for the next day’s
adventure, then gain a Hope. If you choose to Prepare
with one or more members of your party, you each gain 2
Hope.
- **Work on a Project:** With GM approval, a PC may pursue
a long-term project, such as deciphering an ancient text
or crafting a new weapon. The first time they start a new
project, assign it a countdown. Each time a PC makes
the Work on a Project move, they either advance their
project’s countdown automatically or make an action roll
to advance it (GM’s choice).
- 
**At the end of a long rest**, any features or effects with a limited
number of uses per rest or per long rest refresh and any
features or effects that last until your next rest or until your
next long rest expire.

## Downtime Consequences

On a short rest, the GM gains 1d4 Fear. On a long rest, they
gain Fear equal to 1d4 + the number of PCs, and they can
advance a long-term countdown of their choice.

# Death

When a PC marks their last Hit Point, they must make a death
move by choosing one of the following options:

- **Blaze of Glory**: Your character embraces death and
goes out in a blaze of glory. Take one final action. It
automatically critically succeeds (with GM approval), and
then you cross through the veil of death.
- **Avoid Death:** Your character avoids death and faces the
consequences. They temporarily drop unconscious, and
then you work with the GM to describe how the situation
worsens. While unconscious, your character can’t move or
act, and they can’t be targeted by an attack. They return
to consciousness when an ally clears 1 or more of their
marked Hit Points or when the party finishes a long rest.
After your character falls unconscious, roll your Hope Die.
If its value is equal to or less than your character’s level,
they gain a scar: permanently cross out a Hope slot and
work with the GM to determine its lasting narrative impact
and how, if possible, it can be restored. If you ever cross
out your last Hope slot, your character’s journey ends.
- **Risk It All:** Roll your Duality Dice. If the Hope Die is higher,
your character stays on their feet and clears a number
of Hit Points or Stress equal to the value of the Hope Die
(you can divide the Hope Die value between Hit Points and
Stress however you’d prefer). If the Fear Die is higher, your
character crosses through the veil of death. If the Duality
Dice show matching results, your character stays up and
clears all Hit Points and Stress.

If your character dies, work with the GM before the next
session to create a new character at the current level of the
rest of the party.

# Additional Rules

The following rules apply to many aspects of the game.

## Rounding Up
This game doesn’t use fractions; if you need to round to a
whole number, round up unless otherwise specified. When in
doubt, resolve any ambiguity in favor of the PCs.

## Rerolling Dice
When a feature allows you to reroll a die, you always take the
new result unless the feature specifically says otherwise.

## Incoming Damage

Incoming damage means the total damage from a single
attack or source, before Armor Slots are marked.

## Simultaneous Effects

If the resolution order of multiple effects is unclear, the person
in control of the effects (player or GM) decides what order to
resolve them in.

## Stacking Effects

Unless stated otherwise, all effects beside conditions and
advantage/disadvantage can stack.

## Ongoing Spell Effects

If an effect doesn’t have a listed mechanical expiration, it only
ends when decided by the controlling player, the GM, or the
demands of the fiction.

## Spending Resources

Unless an effect states otherwise, you can’t spend Hope or
mark Stress multiple times on the same feature to increase or
repeat its effects on the same roll.

## Using Features After a Roll

If a feature allows you to affect a roll after the result has been
totaled, you can use it after the GM declares whether the roll
succeeds or fails, but not after the consequences unfold or
another roll is made.

# Leveling Up

Your party levels up whenever the GM decides you’ve reached
a narrative milestone (usually about every 3 sessions). All
party members level up at the same time.

## Level Tiers
Daggerheart has 10 PC levels divided into 4 tiers:
- Tier 1 encompasses level 1 only.
- Tier 2 encompasses levels 2–4.
- Tier 3 encompasses levels 5–7.
- Tier 4 encompasses levels 8–10.

Your tier affects your damage thresholds, tier achievements,
and access to advancements.

### Step 1: Tier Achievements

Take any applicable tier achievements

- At level 2, you gain a new Experience at +2 and
permanently increase your Proficiency by 1.
- At level 5, you gain a new Experience at +2, permanently
increase your Proficiency by 1, and clear any marked traits.
- At level 8, you gain a new Experience at +2, permanently
increase your Proficiency by 1, and clear any marked traits.

### Step 2: Advancements

Choose any two advancements with at least one unmarked
slot from your tier or below. Options with multiple slots can be
chosen more than once. When you choose an advancement,
mark one of its slots.

- When you choose to increase two unmarked character
traits and mark them: Choose two unmarked character
traits and gain a permanent +1 bonus to them. You can’t
increase these stats again until the next tier (when your
tier achievement allows you to clear those marks).
- When you choose to permanently add 1 or more Hit Point
slots: Darken the outline of the next rectangle in the Hit
Point section of your character sheet in pen or permanent
marker.
- When you choose to permanently add 1 or more Stress
slots: Darken the outline of the next rectangle in the Stress
section of your character sheet in pen or permanent
marker.
- When you choose to increase your Experience: Choose two
Experiences on your character sheet and gain a permanent
+1 bonus to both.
- When you take an additional domain card: You can choose
an additional domain card at or below your level or from
your class’s domains. If you’ve multiclassed, you can
instead select a card at or below half your level from your
chosen multiclass domain.
- When you choose to increase your Evasion: Gain a
permanent +1 bonus to your Evasion.
- When you choose to take an upgraded subclass card:
Take the next card for your subclass. If you have only
the foundation card, take a specialization; if you have a
specialization already, take a mastery. Then cross out this
tier’s multiclass option.
- When you choose to increase your Proficiency: Fill in one
of the open circles in the “Proficiency” section of your
character sheet, then increase your weapon’s number of
damage dice by 1. The black box around this advancement’s
slots indicates you must spend two advancements and mark
both level-up slots in order to take it as an option.
- When you choose to multiclass: Choose an additional class,
select one of its domains, and gain its class feature. Add
the appropriate multiclass module to your character sheet
and take the foundation card from one of its subclasses.
Then cross out the “upgraded subclass” advancement
option in this tier and all other “multiclass” advancement
options on your character sheet. The black box around
this advancement’s slots indicates you must spend two
advancements and mark both level-up slots in order to take
it as an option.

### Step 3: Damage Thresholds

Increase all damage thresholds by 1.

### Step 4: Domain Cards

Acquire a new domain card at your level or lower from one of
your class’s domains and add it to your loadout or vault. If your
loadout is already full, you can’t add the new card to it until
you move another into your vault. You can also exchange one
domain card you’ve previously acquired for a different domain
card of the same level or lower.

## Multiclassing

Starting at level 5, you can choose multiclassing as an option
when leveling up. When you multiclass, you choose an
additional class, gain access to one of its domains, and acquire
its class feature. Take the appropriate multiclass module and
add it to the right side of your character sheet, then choose a
foundation card from one of its subclasses. If your foundation
cards specify different Spellcast traits, you can choose which
one to apply when making a Spellcast roll.
Whenever you have the option to acquire a new domain card,
you can choose from cards at or below half your current level
(rounded up) from the domain you chose when you selected
the multiclass advancement.

# Equipment

Your equipped weapons and armor are the ones listed in
the “Active Weapons” and “Active Armor” sections of your
character sheet. Your character can only attack with weapons,
benefit from armor, and gain features from items they have
equipped. You can’t equip weapons or armor with a higher tier
than you.

PCs can carry up to two additional weapons in the “Inventory
Weapon” areas of the character sheet.
You can swap an Inventory Weapon with an Active Weapon at
no cost during a rest or moment of calm; otherwise, you must
mark a Stress to do so.

Your character can only have one Active Armor at a time.
They can’t equip armor while in danger or under pressure;
otherwise, they can equip or unequip armor without cost.
Each armor has its own Armor Slots; if your character
unequips their armor, track how many of its Armor Slots are
marked. You can't carry armor in your inventory. When your
character equips or unequips armor, recalculate your damage
thresholds.

## Weapons

All weapons have a tier, trait, range, damage die, damage
type, and burden. Some weapons also have a feature.

### Category
A weapon’s category specifies whether it is a Primary or
Secondary weapon. Your character can only equip up to one
weapon of each category at a time.

### Trait
A weapon’s trait specifies which trait to use when making an
attack roll with it.

### Range
A weapon’s range specifies the maximum distance between
the attacker and their target when attacking with it.

### Damage
A weapon’s damage indicates the size of the damage dice
you roll on a successful attack with it; you roll a number of
dice equal to your Proficiency. If the damage includes a flat
modifier, this number is added to the total damage rolled, but
is not altered or affected by Proficiency.

### Damage Type
A weapon’s damage type indicates whether it deals physical
or magic damage. Weapons that deal magic damage can only
be wielded by characters with a Spellcast trait.

### Burden
A weapon’s burden indicates how many hands it occupies
when equipped. Your character’s maximum burden is 2 hands.

### Feature

A weapon’s feature is a special rule that stays in effect while
the weapon is equipped.

You can throw an equipped weapon at a target within Very
Close range, making the attack roll with Finesse. On a
success, deal damage as usual for that weapon. Once thrown,
the weapon is no longer considered equipped. Until you
retrieve and re-equip it, you can’t attack with it or benefit from
its features.

# Combat Wheelchair

> By Mark Thompson

The combat wheelchair is a ruleset designed to help you play a wheelchair user in Daggerheart. This section provides mechanics
and narrative guidance for you to work from, but feel free to adapt the flavor text to best suit your character. Have fun with your
character’s wheelchair design, and make it as unique or tailored to them as you please.

## Action and Movement

When describing how your character moves, you can use
descriptions such as the following:
- “I roll over to the door to see if it’s open.”
- “I wheel myself over to the group to ask what’s going on.”
- “I pull my brakes and skid to a halt, turning in my seat to
level my bow at the intruder.”

## Consequences

Here are some ways you might describe complications you
encounter when your character uses their wheelchair:
- “I pull my brakes, but I don’t think to account for the loose
gravel on the ground.”
- “I hit a patch of ice awkwardly and am sent skidding out
past my target.”
- “I go to push off in pursuit, but one of my front caster
wheels snags on a crack in the pavement, stalling me for a
moment.”
- 
GMs should avoid breaking a character's wheelchair or
otherwise removing it from play as a consequence, unless
everyone at the table, especially the wheelchair user’s player,
gives their approval.

## Evasion

Your character is assumed to be skilled in moving their
wheelchair and navigating numerous situations in it. As a
result, the only wheelchair that gives a penalty to a PC's
Evasion is the Heavy Frame model.

## Burden

All wheelchairs can be maneuvered using one or two hands
outside of combat. However, when being used as a weapon,
the chair is restricted to requiring one or two hands to
perform attacks, depending on the model you’ve chosen. If
you’re playing a character who has limited to no mobility in
their arms, their wheelchair can be attuned to them by magical
means. For example, your character might use a psychic link
to guide the chair around like a pseudo-electric wheelchair. All
the rules presented here can be tailored and adapted to any
character's needs.

## Choosing you Model

All combat wheelchairs are equipped as Primary Weapons.
There are three models of wheelchair available: light, heavy,
and arcane. You’re encouraged to consider the type of
character you’re playing and the class they belong to, then
choose the model that best matches that character concept.

### Light Frame Models

Though tough, these wheelchairs have light frames that allow the chair to move with your character in more acrobatic ways.
These models are best suited to adventurers who rely on speed and flexibility.

### Heavy Frame Models

These wheelchairs have bulky and heavier frames, allowing the chair to lend its weight to your character’s attacks. It also makes
them a bigger target.

### Arcane Frame Models

These wheelchairs have frames that are attuned to your character and their magic, allowing them to channel their spells through
the chair. Unlike other primary magic weapons, the arcane-frame model doesn’t specify a trait to use when making an attack
with it. Instead, you use the Spellcast trait indicated by your subclass.

# Armor

Every armor has a name, base damage thresholds, and a base Armor Score. Some armor also has a feature.

- An armor’s base armor score indicates how many Armor
Slots it provides its wearer before additional bonuses are
added to calculate their total Armor Score. A PC’s Armor
Score can’t exceed 12.
- An armor’s base thresholds determine its wearer’s major
and severe damage thresholds before adding bonuses to
calculate their final damage thresholds.
- An armor’s feature is a special rule that stays in effect
while the armor is equipped.

While unarmored, your character’s base Armor Score is 0,
their Major threshold is equal to their level, and their Severe
threshold is equal to twice their level.

## Reducing Incoming Damage

When you take damage, you can mark one Armor Slot to
reduce the number of Hit Points you would mark by one. If
your character has an Armor Score of 0, you can’t mark Armor
Slots. If an effect temporarily increases your Armor Score,
it increases your available Armor Slots by the same amount;
when the effect ends, so does the availability of these Armor
Slots.

# LOOT

Loot comprises any consumable or reusable items the party acquires.
Items can be used until sold, discarded, or lost.

## Reusable items

To generate a random reusable item, choose a rarity, roll the designated dice, and match the total to the item in the table:

- Common: 1d12 or 2d12
- Uncommon: 2d12 or 3d12
- Rare: 3d12 or 4d12
- Legendary: 4d12 or 5d12

## Consumables

Consumables are loot that can only be used once. You can hold up to five of each consumable at a time. Using a consumable
doesn’t require a roll unless required by the GM or the demands of the fiction.

To generate a random consumable item, choose a rarity, roll the designated dice, and match the total to the item in the table:

- Common: 1d12 or 2d12
- Uncommon: 2d12 or 3d12
- Rare: 3d12 or 4d12
- Legendary: 4d12 or 5d12

# Gold

Gold is an abstract measurement of how much wealth a
character has, and is measured in handfuls, bags, and chests,
with 10 handfuls to 1 bag, and 10 bags to 1 chest. When you
have marked all of the slots in a category and you gain another
gold reward in that category, mark a slot in the following
category and clear all the slots in the current one.

> For example, if you have 9 handfuls and gain another, you
instead mark 1 bag and erase all handfuls. If you have 9 bags
and gain another, you mark 1 chest and erase all bags.

You can’t have more than 1 chest, so if all your Gold slots are
marked, you’ll need to spend some of your gold or store it
somewhere else before you can acquire more.

## Optional Rule: Gold Coins

If your group wants to track gold with more granularity,
you can add coins as your lowest denomination. Following
the established pattern, 10 coins equal 1 handful.
