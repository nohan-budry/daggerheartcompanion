# DaggerheartCompanion.app

This web app is a personal project I created while learning and preparing to play Daggerheart with friends.
It includes content from the Daggerheart SRD 1.0.

You'll find all the essential information for Game Masters and Players with a focus on game content for now.
Additional information about game mechanics and rules will be added over time.

This is a non-commercial fan project. It only includes material available in the SRD, and is meant to make
that information easier to access and use.

There are still a lot of content and features to add. So keep visiting regularly to check out what's new.
